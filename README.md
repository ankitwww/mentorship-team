# Node.js Mentorship Program

The success of Node.js has transformed my career significantly. I am following up Node.js Mentorship Initiative for a few weeks and now would like to explore it further.
By joining the mentorship program, I would like to get involved in the Node.js ecosystem and slowly attain insights to work in specific working groups and teams.
I also believe that "people" are a vital factor in the success of Node.js - and I would like to work and professionally connect with the other team members.
